# SmartWaterTank - Save water with IoT ðŸš°

SmartWaterTank converts your ordinary tank to a smart one, and helps save some water. Flash the sketch right now on your NodeMCU chip and you are almost ready to go. This sketch not only saves water by turning off the pump for you, but this also helps you in getting a deep analysis of water level & consumption during a selected period of time. To use the sketch at its best, you should SignUp on [Blynk](https://blynk.io/) & [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

## Getting Started ðŸš€

Before proceeding I expect that you already have decent knowledge of programming and circuits. 

#### 1. Circuit

For making this project you're gonna need a NodeMCU and an Ultrasonic sensor. Assemble them together as shown in the image down below. Later, you can assemble these parts as per your needs in the wanter tank. Just make sure that ultrasonic sensor is attached to tank lid (facing downwards) and none of the electrical components or circuits have any contact with water.

* This image is just for demonstration. Actual pin numbers may vary in the Sketch uploaded in this repository.

#### 2. Blynk Project

Now download the Blynk app and setup a project. For viewing the water level add a graph widget and for controlling your water pump or water device you wanna interact with, create a webhook widget. Also copy the Blynk token of your project from the app.

#### 3. Finish

You should now create a webhook URL on IFTTT for performing action on your connected appliance. Once ready put your URL in the webhook widget of the Blynk project we created in step 2. Now you can plug in your NodeMCU and configure it from your mobile phone. Once configured, your NodeMCU will restart and should be shown online in the Blynk app dashboard.

âœ‹ If you wish, you can deep dive into the arduino sketch and can modify it according to your needs. There you should also be able to find some more components attaching options already available. Like - Reset button & Status LED.
